# Star Wars Client

This is a simple React app for ingesting the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/).


## Build setup

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# start server
yarn start

# check tests? 👀
yarn test
```


## Overview

As this is a simple consume website for the Star Wars API - there are a few things a user is probably going to want to do.

1. View all root types, and the resources inside them
2. Click though and see a detailed breakdown of the information on each resource type
3. Easily access other linked resources
4. Favorite a resource type - this must persist after page refresh however it doesn't need to be stored on a server, it can be stored _locally_


## Core requirements

- Show a good understanding of core ES6 syntax
- Be responsive
- Have loading states - this is a good place to showcase your animation skills 😉
- Must work flawlessly in all of the major browsers (Chrome, Safari, IE11, and Edge)


## Design

- This isn't an exercise in design, but a good understanding of basic UX principles will be a very strong bonus.
- This is Star Wars isn't it? Have some fun! 🚀 👽


## Brownie points

- Use redux sagas 📖
- SASS (.scss syntax) 💃
- Inline resource filtering 🕵🏻‍♀️
- Unit tests 👩‍🔬


Have fun, we look forward to seeing what you've come up with.
